## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Farajollah (Fred)**, an AI/ML enthusiast with a **PhD in Computer Science**.  I currently work as a PostDoc Research Associate at the University of York, where I develop bioâ€‘inspired engineering design tools as part of the [REID](https://riedesign.org/) project. 


- ðŸ”­ **Current projects:** bioâ€‘inspired generative design with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Reinforcement Learningss (RL), and Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP)
- ðŸŒ± **Learning:** advanced graph machineâ€‘learning and RL techniques   
- ðŸ‘¯ **Open to collaborate on:** multiâ€‘objective optimization, reinforcement learning, generative design, geoâ€‘spatial data analytics, and ML predictive models  
- ðŸ“« **Reach me at:** [f.taher@york.ac.uk](mailto:f.taher@york.ac.uk)
