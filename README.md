## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Farajollah (Fred)**, an AI/ML enthusiast with a **PhD in Computer Science**.  I currently work as a PostDoc Research Associate at the University of York, where I develop bioâ€‘inspired engineering design tools using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP)** as part of the [REID](https://riedesign.org/) project. 


- ðŸ”­ **Current projects:** bioâ€‘inspired generative design with GNNs, RL, and CGP:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- ðŸŒ± **Learning:** advanced graph machineâ€‘learning techniques and generative AI  
- ðŸ‘¯ **Open to collaborate on:** multiâ€‘objective optimization, reinforcement learning, generative design, supplyâ€‘chain analytics, and AIâ€‘enabled sustainability  
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:** evolutionary algorithms, RL, graph networks, brainâ€‘machine interfaces, or data analytics  
- ðŸ“« **Reach me at:** [f.taher@york.ac.uk](mailto:f.taher@york.ac.uk)
